Introduction
------------

K-means clustering is a type of unsupervised learning, which is used when you have unlabeled data (i.e., data without defined categories or groups). It attempts to partition \[latex\]n\[/latex\] observed samples into \[latex\]k\[/latex\] clusters by their similarity (nearest mean), but not driven by a specific purpose. K-means algorithm works iteratively to assign each data point to one of \[latex\]k\[/latex\] groups based on the features that are provided. With K-means clustering algorithm, we will obtain some result from data

*   The centroids of the K clusters, which can be used to label new data.
    
*   Labels for the training data (each data point is assigned to a single cluster).
